        Promote a Herd Follower to Leader Status

        This process is fairly complicated, and comes in several parts:

        1. Stop the current primary node. This ensures only the secondary
           can accept new data.
        2. Promote the top follower to read/write status. This essentially
           makes it the new leader of the herd.
        3. Assign the follower as the new stream source to the old primary.
           This officially swaps the roles of the two nodes. Note that the
           new follower is still out of sync with the new leader. This will
           require a separate node rebuild step to rectify.
        4. Move the declared virtual host to the new leader.
        5. Reassign all replicas to follow the new leader. We do this last
           because it relies on DNS propagation, and pushing a reload after
           that step implies a reconnection.
