# Start with some basic variable assignments. To satisfy either Debian or
# RHEL systems, we will check the /etc/default and /etc/sysctl directories
# for variable overrides. Variables that can be changed in these scripts
# include:
#
#   * DISABLE     : Set to 1 to disable service start. 0 by default.
#   * LOG_DIR     : Directory where service logs should be created.
#   * BIN_DIR     : Directory where the elephaas binary resides.
#   * ADMIN_USER  : Name of the system user that will run elephaas.
#                   Default: postgres.
#   * EXTRA_OPTS  : Arbitrary options to pass to elephaas service.
#                   Default: 0.0.0.0:8000

DISABLE=0
CONF_DIR=/etc/$NAME

# as shortcuts.

# Since this script runs as root, make sure the logging and pid directories
# exist, and are writable by the elephaas user.
